London Gophers, aka The Go London User Group (GLUG), are a London-based community for anyone interested in the Go
programming language. London Gophers held their first Meetup on Wednesday, March 27, 2013, and since then the group has
grown to over 3,000 members.

London Gophers typically hold a Meetup once a month at a variety of venues across the city. All Meetups are free, and
typically comprise a number of talks and socialising, with food and drink provided. We live-stream all Meetups via our
[YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/LondonGophers), where you can also find an archive of previous recordings.

Membership of London Gophers is managed via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/LondonGophers/); everyone is
welcome! We also have an active [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/LondonGophers) and our members are active in the
`#london` [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/) ([sign-up here](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org)).

### Code of Conduct

London Gophers operate under the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).

### Sponsors

London Gophers is a volunteer-run organisation that seeks to remain as friendly and welcoming as possible to everyone.
Therefore membership of London Gophers is 100% free and we do not charge for attending events. Not only that, but we
provide food and drink at all of our events. We therefore rely on sponsorship to cover our costs. Thank you to our
sponsors!
