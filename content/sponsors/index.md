London Gophers is a volunteer-run organisation that seeks to remain as friendly and welcoming as possible to everyone. 
Therefore, membership of London Gophers is 100% free, and we do not charge for attending events. Not only that, 
but we provide food and drink at all of our events. We therefore rely on sponsorship to cover our costs. 
Thank you to our sponsors!

## Venue Sponsors
These are the venues that have hosted us in the past few months. Thank you!

## How to Sponsor London Gophers

We are currently still getting set up, since the post-pandemic restart so do not have a sponsorship program in place, 
but if you'd like to have a conversation about sponsoring London Gophers in the future please contact us at:
