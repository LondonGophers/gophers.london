London Gophers is a volunteer-run organisation that seeks to remain as friendly and welcoming as possible to everyone. 
Therefore, membership of London Gophers is 100% free, and we do not charge for attending events. Not only that, 
but we provide food and drinks at all of our events. We therefore rely on sponsorship to cover our costs. 
Thank you to our sponsors!
