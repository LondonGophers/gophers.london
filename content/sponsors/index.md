London Gophers is a volunteer-run organisation that seeks to remain as friendly and welcoming as possible to everyone. 
Therefore, membership of London Gophers is 100% free, and we do not charge for attending events. Not only that, 
but we provide food and drinks at all of our events. We therefore rely on sponsorship to cover our costs. 
Thank you to our sponsors!

## Venue Sponsors
These are the venues that have hosted us in the past few months. Thank you!

### Paddle
Paddle offers SaaS companies a completely different approach to their payments infrastructure. Instead of assembling and maintaining a complex stack of payments-related apps and services, we’re a merchant of record for our customers, taking away 100% of the pain of payments fragmentation. It’s faster, safer, simpler and, above all, way better.
