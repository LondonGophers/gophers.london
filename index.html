      <p>The Go London User Group (GLUG) is a London-based community for anyone interested in the Go programming language. GLUG
held their first Meetup on Wednesday, March 27, 2013, and since then the group has grown to over 2,500 members.</p>

<p>Nowadays, GLUG is more commonly known as <strong>London Gophers</strong>. London Gophers typically hold a Meetup once a month at a
variety of venues across the city. All Meetups are free, and typically comprise a number of talks and socialising, with
food and drink provided. We live-stream all Meetups via our <a href="https://twitter.com/LondonGophers">YouTube channel</a>, where
you can also find an archive of previous recordings.</p>

<p>Membership of London Gophers is managed via our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/">Meetup page</a>; everyone is
welcome! We also have an active <a href="https://twitter.com/LondonGophers">Twitter feed</a> and our members are active in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">#london</code> <a href="https://gophers.slack.com/">Gophers Slack</a> (<a href="https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org">sign-up here</a>).</p>
